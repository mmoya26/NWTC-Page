    <h1>Olympic Test</h1>
    <h2>Differences</h2>
    <p>Google Chrome and Internet Explorer pictures are going to look a little bit smaller just because I couldn't find an option like on Fifrefox on how to take a screenshot of the entire Page.
    Anyways, the page looks very similar something I did notice that is not on the Internet Explorer picture because of the screenshot problem is that, on Internet Explorer my Return Home link
    doesn't go all they way like on the firefox, that can be fixed with a little bit of CSS maybe instead of using hard pixels using percentages so it won't be  cut off.</p>
