      <h3>Tallest Stacked Cup Monument</h3>
      <p>This is a team event where teams of at least 2, but no more than 5 athletes will join forces to build the tallest stacked cup monument.
        Standard-issued plastic cups of varied colors will be provided. No additional tools, including ladders, can be used.
        The structure must stand without any additional support for 3 minutes to be considered as a medal winning monument.
      </p>

      <h3>Fastest Stack</h3>
      <p>Individuals will be competing in a timed cup stacking event. All individuals are competing in one bracket.
        Athletes will be given 144 standard-issues plastic cups of varied colors to use. The top 3 athletes to construct and de-construct the structure using all plastic cups without issue will be
        awarded medals.
