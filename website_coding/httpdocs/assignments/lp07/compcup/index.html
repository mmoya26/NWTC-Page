      The structure must stand without any additional support for 3 minutes to be considered as a medal winning monument.
    </p>

    <h3>Fastest Stack</h3>
    <p>Individuals will be competing in a timed cup stacking event. All individuals are competing in one bracket.
      Athletes will be given 144 standard-issues plastic cups of varied colors to use. The top 3 athletes to construct and de-construct the structure using all plastic cups without issue will be
      awarded medals.</p>
