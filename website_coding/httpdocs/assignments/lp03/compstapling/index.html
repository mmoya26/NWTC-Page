    <h1>Competitive Stapling</h1>
    <h2>This year's competitive stapling event features athletes from 13 countries and split between two categories.</h2>

    <h3>Fastest Stapling</h3>
    <p>Athletes will be timed in stapling two reams worth of paper in groups of 14 sheets of paper using a standard-issued stapler.
      The paper must be hand-counted and stapled using a non-automated stapler by individual. This is not a team-event.
      There will be age classes in this event, and medals will be awarded by age class:</p>

      <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>Women & Men, Ages 15-30</li>
        <li>Women & Men, Ages 30-45</li>
        <li>Women & Men, Ages 45-60</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Weight Stapling</h3>
      <p>In this event, athletes will compete to see how can staple the thickest packet of paper using a standard-issued stapler.
        Should the staple not protrude through the back of the last sheet of paper, the athlete will be disqualified. This is certainly a risky event, as there are no second chances.
        One staple--that's all each athlete gets. For this event, there are weight brackets by gender:</p>

        <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
          <li>39 to 42 kg (86 to 92 lb)</li>
          <li>46 kg (101 lb)</li>
          <li>50 kg (110 lb)</li>
          <li>54 kg (119 lb)</li>
          <li>58 kg (128 lb)</li>
          <li>63 kg (139 lb)</li>
          <li>69 kg (152 lb)</li>
          <li>76 kg (167 lb)</li>
          <li>85 kg (187 lb)</li>
          <li>85 to 100 kg (187 to 220 lb)</li>
        </ul>
