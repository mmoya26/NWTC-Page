      <h3>Website Review of youtube.com</h3>

      <p>In my opinion, I believe that Youtube's website is a perfect example of the use of thumbnails on a websites. I spend a lot of time on Youtube, more than I should if we are being honest.
      When you first enter to Youtube's website a bunch of thumbnails of videos will display on your screen of recommended videos by Youtube that you should watch. These thumbails contain an image
      that sometimes describes what the video is going to be about or it shows apart of that video.</p>

      <p>Overall, I believe that the Youtube website has a clean user interface everything is organized with really good color selection, and it gets even better if you go dark mode it makes everything
      feel more calm.</p>
