	<h3>Website Review of <a href="https://www.shopify.com/partners/blog/what-is-progressive-enhancement-and-why-should-you-care">shopify.com</a></h3>

	<p>Today we will be looking at Shopify's article about Progressive Enhancement and why it's important. But before all that, let's talk about Shopify's website looks.</p>

	<p>In my opinion, I think the website has a clean design, with only a few selections of colors mainly being white and like a dark-light blue. Everything is spaced out properly, which gives the user a lot of breathing room, I also like the font that they are using for their site.</p>

	<p>But now to the content, Progressive Enhancement is basically a way to provide users with the essential content and functionality to as many users as possible across all types of devices or screens. Progressive Enhancement is very important when creating a website because we want to be able as a Developer to give access to the content on the page that we are working on to pretty much everyone that has a computer with a browser However, because technology keeps on advancing every day, it's sometimes hard to keep up with older machines or browsers to display the content that we want on their screens which is why Progressive Enhancement is so important.<p>
