    <h3>Website Review of ikea.com</h3>

    <p>When I first entered the Ikea website the first thing I noticed is that the website design is a little bit flat, meaning that there isn't really a bunch of outstanding features that would catch your
    eyes right away. However the website is really easy to browse around, they list almost anything a costumer may be looking for on their nav-bar.</p>

    <p>Like for example they have a search bar which you can use if you want to look into a specific item that you might have in mind, they also have an offer section on their nav-bar that lists all of the offers that Ikea has at the moment.
      So overall they have a clean and easy website to browse around.</p>

    <p>In my opinion if I had to re-design the website I would just use different colors and make the website look not so flat, and maybe add some moving features with JavaScript. </p>
