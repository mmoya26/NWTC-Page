      <h3>Website Review of microsoft.com and tesla.com</h3>

      <p>Today I'll be reviewing Microsoft's website and to start off I just want to point out that the design that Microsoft went with for the website is the "Jello Design" meaning
      that the content on the screen is either fixed or a percentage width meaning that it will vary device to device and it will adjust to the screen of the device which is really good for user
      experience and usability. The website will most likely have 3 break points, first one being "Desktop" mode meaning that the content on the screen will occupy 100% of the width of the screen, second
      one being "Tablet" mode which won't occupy 100% of the screen but you will be able to see the content a little bit bigger compared to the third break point which is "Phone" where all the content
      gets shrink down to make it fit on your phone screen perfectly.</p>

      <p>Now looking at Microsoft's website, the website has a very clean layout making it easier for us users to browse around it and look at everything that microfost has to offer to us. At the
      very top we have a carousel which at the moment displays two images, one talking about Office 365, and the other one about deals for Surface Laptops. Microsoft also did great on the color
      selection making the website have this relaxing and fancy vibe. Also on their navbar microsfot list almost all of the important services that an user might be looking for, such as, Windows,
      Surface, Xbox, etc.</p>

      <p>Overall Microsoft has very clean easy to browse website.</p>

      <hr>
      
      <p>Tesla uses the liquid design layout meaning that the user has control over how he or she wants her page to look like. they can adjust the page around to make it fit to meet the needs. I love
      How tesla's website is so simple yet so fancy, everything that you are looking for is right up top, lisiting all four models of the cars that they are currently offering.</p>

      <p>Tesla also uses simple colors, black and white. The website has a lot of breathing space meaning that the user can browse around without being overwhelmend. Overall a very clean and clever
      web layout and web design.</p>
