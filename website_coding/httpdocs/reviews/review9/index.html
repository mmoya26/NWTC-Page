    <h3>Website Review of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a></h3>

    <p>I used Facebook's page for my example of a form, in this case, it is their register form, where users can sign up to have an account on Facebook.
      I believe that the method for this form is to "post" it to their database so they can save our information so we can, later on, log into Facebook.
      They have a couple different types of input's, one for email or phone number, a couple of radio buttons, and also drop-down menus too.
    </p>

    <p>Overall the website it's pretty clean I mean it's Facebook, they are a big company and they put a lot thought on their design.</p>
