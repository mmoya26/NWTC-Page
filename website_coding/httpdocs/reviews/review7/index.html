    <h3>Website Review of <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a></h3>

    <p>Structural elements are pretty important when it comes down to creating a website, especially if a lot of developers will be collaborating with that website.
    Structural elements are basically semantic elements that actually give meaning to different pieces of your website. For example, if you are working on an article instead of
    just creating a div and then give it a class or an id called article instead of using the element div you would use the article element to make your code more semantic which
    basically means meaningful because at the end of the day when making a website we have to make sure that other people can look  at your code and figure out what part is what and
    that they are able to understand it.</p>

    <p>For this particular website review, I used W3Schools as my example of a semantic website, they have a well constructed and the website has a basic design with basic colors such as green and grey.
      Overall the websites have a clean user interface and a lot of content for new developers trying to learn web design.</p>
