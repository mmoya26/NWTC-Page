    <h3>Website Review of <a href="http://localtown.us/menekaunee-wi/">Menekaunee</a></h3>

    <p>
      Menekaunee's website has a table-based layout meaning that the website layout is pretty much based all on tables which nowadays a lot of web developer consider a very poorly web layout.
      Nowadays developers much rather use CSS to handle website layouts instead of using tables just because working with tables to simply make a layout for a website is way harder than using CSS.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, this is an old website mainly designed to, give information about a small town in Wisconsin. Like I mentioned before I strongly believe that developers use CSS for layouts simply because it can be done better and much faster rather than using tables.
      Plus in reality, as developers, we want to be as far away as possible from using HTML for design aspects of our page mainly because HTML
      was designed mainly for content only, and not styling or looks of a page.
