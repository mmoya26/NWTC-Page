    <h3>Website Review of apple.com</h3>

    <p>The amount of breathing space, and easy access to different places of the website, are only a couple of the many reasons why I choose apple.com for my website review. If you are looking
    into buying an Apple product and having an amazing user experience I would personally recommend you to try buying their products on their website. And be ready for an amazing, and fast experience.</p>

    <p>Apple's home page like I mentioned before has a lot of breathing space meaning that the user won't be overwhelmed by how much stuff is  being thrown into their eyes at the time. As you scroll down
    their website you can clearly see that Apple has designed their website  in a clever and simple way, having different sections for the different products that Apple sells.
    Of course  having the most of important  product at the top of the page their iPhone X.</p>


    <p>Apple not only made their website simple and fancy by having a lot of breathing space, but also the color selection is also simple. They use soft colors that won't bother yours eyes, like a really strong yellow or a really strong red.
    What they did instead was just pick two main colors black, and white. Of course not mentioning the colors of their products which are also very relaxing and fit perfectly with theme of the website.</p>

    <p>I hope everyone enjoys this website as much as I do!</p>
