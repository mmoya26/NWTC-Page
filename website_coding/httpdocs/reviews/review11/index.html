    <h3>Website Review of <a href="https://www.domain.com/">Domain.com</a></h3>

    <p>Let's start talking about the web design, it's beautiful, very clean, a lot of space for the user to browse around. When you first enter the website you right away have
    search bar to look up a domain that you're wondering if it is available or not, overall amazing website.</p>

    <p>I was looking for the domain of mmoya.com, for my portfolio but apparently the domain it's already taken. Even though the .com is already taken there are a lot more options
    that they give you that can use the same name but different domain, for example, they offered me to look at mmoya.net, moya.space, mmoya.online and many other options.</p>

    <p>Personally, I would select the .net option just because the domain is a lot more common than the other ones. Even though it is a little bit more expensive than the rest of the other
    options ($12.99 a year) compared to ($6.99 a year and $5.99 a year) I feel like .net is just more professional.</p>
