        <h3>Website Review of csszengarden.com</h3>

        <p>While the CSS Zen Garden website is a good resource to look at examples of how powerful the CSS language can be, I personally think that the website itself could have more outstading elements
        that will catch the audience eyes right away.</p>

        <p>On the other hand the website has a clean interface, easy to browse around, relaxing colors such as green, and white. And like I mentioned before it is a great resource to look at
        some of the examples on what CSS can do to websites, I personally have visited this website before, and not a lot has changed since last time I visited. At least design wise.</p>

        <p>If I had the chance to re-create the page I would add some images to the site. Because as for right now, there's too many words on the website and it kinda feels like I'm reading a newsletter.
