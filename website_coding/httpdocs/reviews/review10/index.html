    <h3>Review of <a href="https://www.comingsoon.net/trailers">Coming Soon</a></h3>

    <p>I'll be reviewing the "Coming Soon" website which is a website that was basically designed for the public to stay tuned with the latest trailers
      about the latests movies coming out. Overall the design is not bad in my opinion, but it could definitely be improved. It feels like there
      isn't really a lot of breathing space for the user, feels like all of the content is just stacked together, but it works and it does what
      its supposed to do.

      <p>
        They do use the "video" tag instead of using a flash file simply because is not a secret for almost every developer that
        flash is declining pretty bad, because of compatibility issues with older machines among other facts too. The user also has to install flash to interact with flash files when with HTML5 the user doesn't have to. Flash is not supported by iOS, and flash cannot run on all mobile devices.
        So we can kinda see a pattern of lack of compatibility with older machines or browsers, which is why Flash is not really around anymore
        at least not as much like it used to be.
